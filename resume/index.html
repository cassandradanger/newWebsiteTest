	<h2 class="about_me">
Thank you for taking the time to look at my resume! I have recently become very interested in front-end development and for the last several months, I've been teaching myself how to use HTML and CSS to create functional and beautiful websites with clean, efficient code. I got interested in writing code because I love the idea of creating something out of nothing. I also love the fact that I can type in a few lines and immediately see what I made. I know this is something I want to do because the hours fly by whenever I start typing.
Here are some additional skills of mine that might not be highlighted in the sections below:<br/>
<span class="bold">HTML | CSS | SMACCS | JS and JQuery | Photoshop | InDesign | Illustrator | Dreamweaver | Microsoft Office</span>
